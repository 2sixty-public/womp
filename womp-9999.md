# What is a WTIP

WTIP stands for XXX Technology Innovation Proposal (TIP for short). A WTIP is a document providing the XXX Product Development and Data community with information on proposed changes to standards that the working team and community agreed to adhere to.
WTIP is the primary document to communicate changes to:
- Processes and governance
- Architecture patterns
- Software development guidelines or standards
- Shared technology choices (software, infrastructure, vendor)

# WTIP Audience

The primary audience is the body comprised of technology and product leaders of companies actively participating in XXX.XXXX. This primary audience is expected to be the source of WTIPs.
Secondary audience is all the XXX participating companies. Everyone needs to be able to see what criteria they need to adhere to in order to be a part of XXX.XXXX.

# WTIP Types

## Standard

A change or introduction of an architecture pattern, implementation guideance, development standard or technology choice.

## Information

Guidance on how to use architecture patterns, implementation and technology gotchas.

## Process

A change or introduction of a process

# WTIP Workflow

## XXX.XXXX steering council

“Steering Council” or “Council” refers to a group of people elected to manage the choices driven by the WTIPs. The election process and the membership is defined and published in WTIP 0002. 

## Core developers and Product Architectects

“Core developers” refers to product and technology leaders responsible for:
* Electing the “Steering Council” members
* Development and sponsorship of WTIPs
* Implementation of WTIP mandates, choices, and processes
Membership is granted by invite from the Council. Overall approval and sponsorship is provided by the XXX CTO Team.

## WTIP editors

Core developers will invite “WTIP editors” who will usually be members of their teams. The WTIP editors have the ability and rights to edit and maintain WTIPs to which they have been invited. Editors are not automatically added to the "Core Developers".

## WTIP lifecycle

The WTIP process starts with a new idea for a XXX.XXXX standard, process or information. Each proposal must have a focused scope on a single idea.
Each WTIP needs a Champion who is responsible for preparing, maintaining, socializing, and driving the WTIP through the process. It is a good practice to socialize the idea before submitting the WTIP through appropriate channels. These channels will be defined in WTIP0003. This process is necessary to check if the idea is WTIPable and if it will get enough traction to get incorporated. At this stage the WTIP is in a Draft format.

WTIPs are stored in a repository. Each new WTIP starts its life on its own branch and is numbered as WTIP9999. A pull request is raised. Steering council will regularly review these PRs. If the draft is found to be satisfactory it will be assigned a WTIP number and its status changed to ‘Proposed’. This starts a review process driven by the Champion. The review process needs to give all the Core members enough time to have a discussion the proposal and make appropriate amendments. The amendments are implemented by the Champion.

After the consultation period, WTIP is voted in by a majority of the Council and moved to a ‘Final’ state.

Fields marked with “*” are optional.

## Body

The body of WTIP is not standardised, but it is suggested that you should provide at least three sections:
- Context - outlining the problem and its surroundings
- Solution/Decision - outlining how to address the problem
- Impact - positive, neutral and negative effects and side effects

## Additional files

A WTIP may need additional files. Such files should be named `wtip-XXXX-Y.ext`, where `XXXX` is the WTIP number, `Y` is a serial number (starting at 1), and `ext` is replaced by an actual extension.
Alternatively, supporting files may be placed in a subdirectory called `wtip-XXXX`, where `XXXX` is the WTIP number. There are no name constraints in a subdirectory.
